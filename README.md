## VBA - Module 2 Challenge

**Overview of Project**

This project was designed to analyze several stocks option for the years 2017 and 2018. With a new demand to increase significantly 
the dataset and include the entire stock market for the last few years, the code was refactored to increase its time performance.

**Results**

With the code refactored the Macro performance increased, thus it runs in a shorter timeframe. For the 2017 stock analysis in the 
initial code, it was taking 0.890625 seconds to run and with the refactored code it took only 0.1640624 seconds. We have a simmilar
scenario for 2018, in which the time to run it decreases from 0.875 to 0.15625 seconds.

**Summary**

The main disadvantage of refactoring a code is that it consumes a lot of time and it is hard to know where to start from.
The advantage is that you are improving a code that already exists, so it will improve performance, it will be easier to maintain it
and it probably will be less complex than the initial version.
